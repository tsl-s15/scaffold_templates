# scaffold_templates

## Setup
First, make sure you've added and installed the following gems:

1. [simple form gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form)
2. [font-awesome rails gem](https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass)

## Installation

1. Place the entire `scaffold` folder into `/lib/templates/erb/`. So, the path to the index template file should be `/lib/templates/erb/scaffold/index.html`
2. Place the `application.html.erb` in the `layout` folder into you `/app/views/layouts`. You'll replace your original layout file with this new template.
